The **Hope Turtle Project** is a regenerative humanitarian technology initiative designed to deliver aid **across oceans using ocean currents** — powered by **open-source hardware** and **regenerative design principles**.

Each **Hope Turtle** is a solar-powered marine drone built from bamboo and recycled materials.  
They carry serialized bottles of food and medicine, trackable across the seas through this Node.js web platform.
