  <main class="about-main">
    <p>
      The <strong>Hope Turtle Project</strong> began as a dream to unite human creativity, compassion, and
      regenerative technology to help those most in need — even across oceans and borders.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each Hope Turtle is an autonomous, solar-powered marine drone built from bamboo and recycled materials.
      It carries bottles filled with food, medicine, and messages of hope — using the Earth's ocean currents
      as its guiding force.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project integrates <strong>Buwana Authentication</strong> for transparent, collaborative
      coordination across regenerative apps such as GoBrik and EarthCal.
    </p>

    <p class="about-highlight">
      “May love and light flow human to human, across borders.”<br />
      — Hope Turtle Motto
    </p>

    <p>
      HopeTurtles.org serves as the public tracking platform where each turtle’s journey can be followed in
      real time — celebrating success stories of human-to-human aid.
